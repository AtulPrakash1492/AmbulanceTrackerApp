<p> PURPOSE :</p>
<br>
<p>
The purpose of developing this app is to provide ease of accessibility to the user as many times, many students do not get access to the ambulance at the required moment of time.
</p><br> 
<p> SCOPE :</p>
<br>
<p>
It will make the access of an ambulance for the students easier with the convenience of being able to see the availability of the ambulance and the facility to directly call the driver currently on duty to get the estimated time of availability. Also, the authorities can keep a track of where the ambulance is at a particular time as its live location with necessary credentials would be shared.
And this can be implemented on a larger scale as well. We can build such an application on which various hospitals/private vendors in a particular city can register their ambulances, which common people can have access to.  
</p><br>
<p> PROPOSED SYSTEM :</p>
<br>
<p>
The Ambulance Tracking  System aims to give the student a hassle-free experience of using the ambulance when in need. There are obviously many advantages of this system to the student as well as the teacher and the associated  educational institution. The system after certain analysis contains 3 segments - Students, Authorities and Driver. Each segment will have a different interface and different features accordingly.
